                <h2>Tips for Maintaining Your HVAC System</h2>
                <p>To keep your HVAC system running smoothly and efficiently, regular maintenance is essential. Here are some detailed tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Change Air Filters Regularly</b>: Dirty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_filter">air filters</a> can obstruct airflow and reduce system efficiency. It’s recommended to replace air filters every 1-3 months, depending on usage and filter type. Clean filters improve air quality and help your system operate more effectively.</li>
                    <li><b>Schedule Annual Maintenance</b>: Annual inspections and servicing by professional technicians are crucial for optimal system performance. Regular maintenance helps identify potential issues early, ensures your system is running efficiently, and extends its lifespan.</li>
                    <li><b>Keep Vents Clear</b>: Ensure that vents and registers are not blocked by furniture, drapes, or other objects. Unobstructed airflow allows your system to heat or cool your home more effectively and prevents strain on the system.</li>
                    <li><b>Check for Leaks</b>: Inspect your ductwork periodically for any leaks or damage. Leaky ducts can lead to significant energy loss and reduced system performance. Sealing leaks and repairing damaged ducts ensures that conditioned air is delivered efficiently throughout your home.</li>
                </ul>
